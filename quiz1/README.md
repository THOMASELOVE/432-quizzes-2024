Don't forget that the bonus question for Quiz 1 is **now** available on [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/).

- Look for the **Quiz 1 Bonus Question: "How to be a modern scientist"** post (it's #40).
- Responses are due to [Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/) at the same time that the main part of Quiz 1 is due.
- The bonus question will be worth either 3 or 4 points for a complete and well-written response, with some partial credit potentially available.
- As of Wednesday 2024-02-21 at 3:20 PM, I had responses from 12 of you, out of 39. That's a pretty low rate.
